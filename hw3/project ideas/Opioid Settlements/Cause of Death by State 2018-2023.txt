Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when Autopsy, Place of Death, Education, Industry, Usual Occupation,"
"Weekday or Month are grouped by or limited, due to lack of a valid population. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#NotApplicableRates."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Unreliable."
"4. Connecticut population estimates for 2022 and later years are reported for 9 planning regions as county equivalent areas,"
"instead of the former 8 legacy counties in the Vintage 2022 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 22, 2023,"
